        <p><b>Book Description:</b>
            <br> The Dursleys were so mean that hideous that summer that all 
            Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for
            Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, 
             Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named 
             Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.
            And strike it does. 
            For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and 
            horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, 
            Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, 
            and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.
            Could it possibly be Hagrid?</br>

                 in many different ways ... their magical prowess

                 The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. 
                 Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter 
                 - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win 
                 the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of
                  Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his 
                  name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. 
                  He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, 
                  but with the help of his best friends.</br>
